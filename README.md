# NYC-Taxi-Demand-Prediction
The goal of this project is to build a model that predicts trip amount of yellow taxi in NYC. 

The data required is stored in the data folder and it is downloaded from https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page. The whole dataset consists of approximately 30 million observations. Accompanied is the data dictionary that describes the data set.

The report is consisted of six parts:
1. Data exploration and processing
2. Geo data visualization
3. Complex seasonal forecasting
4. Model building
5. Model implementation
6. Model enhancement
